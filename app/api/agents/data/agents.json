Vypa's solo attacks against her country's military dictatorship were so prolific the military assumed her work was the result of a small team of people. At one point, Vypa mistook a remote Guerrilla Warfare (GW) training ground for a government outpost. Shortly after invoking one of her infamous 'sting and choke' maneuvers on the camp she realized her mistake, but not before she had Capt. Crasswater tied up to a tree and threatened at knife point. Impressed and a little frightened, Crasswater recruited Vypa and her sisters into the GW. Together they now lead all jungle-based GW missions and 'government awareness' campaigns. \\n\\n<i>Don't worry, it's just me.</i>",

After a botched rescue attempt by ST6 and subsequent military cover-up, the US Navy declared Crasswater deceased. Over the years of his imprisonment, his patriotism and 'no man left behind' mantra eroded into bitter hatred for all things USA. Newly armed with a severe case of Stockholm Syndrome, Crasswater joined the Trappers of the GW. After a series of 'trust building' attacks on western embassies, Crasswater became GW's most valuable asset—bringing military discipline and organization to an otherwise chaotic gang of rebel fighters. In recent years Crasswater has grown new GW cells at undisclosed locations across Central America. \\n\\n<i>Just one more forget-me-not.</i>",
